<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A family favorite when a no-bake, fast pie is needed. (And family members too small to use the oven can make
    dessert!) Very pretty when garnished with whipped cream and mint leaves.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust </li>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk </li>
    <li>2 lemons, juiced </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon rind. Mix
        until smooth. Pour mixture into crust. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving. Garnish with whipped cream
        and mint leaves if desired.</li>
</ol>
